# Hooks

Lifecycle hooks allow triggering custom code at each step of the page transition process. Read on to
learn about [registering handlers](#registering-handlers) or jump straight to the
[list of available hooks](#list).

## Registering handlers

You can register handlers on swup's `hooks` registry. All handlers receive the [visit object](/visit/)
with information about the current visit as their first argument.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('page:view', (visit) => {
  console.log('New page loaded:', visit.to.url);
});
```

### Handler options

Pass in an options object to customize how a handler is invoked.

#### once

Execute the handler once, then remove it.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('page:view', () => {}, { once: true });
```

#### before

Execute the handler before the internal default handler.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('content:replace', () => {}, { before: true });
```

#### priority

Influence the order in which this handler is run in relation to other handlers for the same hook,
regardless of order of registration. The default priority is `0` â€” negative values make the handler
execute earlier, positive values make it execute later.

```javascript
// Execute before other handlers
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', () => {}, { priority: -100 });

// Execute after other handlers
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', () => {}, { priority: 100 });
```

#### Shortcuts

There are shortcuts available for common handler options:

```javascript
swup.hooks.once('page:view', () => {}); // once: true
swup.hooks.before('content:replace', () => {}); // before: true
```

## Pausing execution

Swup will await Promises returned from handlers, allowing you to pause execution.

```javascript
// Delay the start of the page transition by 1 second
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', () => {
  return new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, 1000));
});
```

This means that `async/await` handlers are supported as well:

```javascript
// Wait for a custom function before starting the transition
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', async () => {
  await myCustomFunction();
});
```

> **Note** Some hooks are executed without awaiting Promises if their handler needs
to prevent a DOM event's default action: `link:click` and `history:popstate`.

## Removing handlers

Remove a previously registered handler by passing in the function to remove.

```javascript
const handler = () => console.log('New page loaded');

// Register a handler
swup.hooks.on('page:view', handler);

// Remove it again later
swup.hooks.off('page:view', handler);
```

## List of hooks {#list}

The following hooks are exposed by swup and can be listened to. Refer to the
[lifecycle diagram](/lifecycle/#lifecycle-diagram) for a visual overview of when the most important
hooks are called. Install the [Debug Plugin](/plugins/debug-plugin) to log triggered hooks to the
browser console as they are happening.

## Examples

### Trigger analytics page views

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('page:view', () => {
  ga('set', 'title', document.title);
  ga('set', 'page', window.location.pathname);
  ga('send', 'pageview');
});
```

### Initialize new components on the page

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('page:view', () => {
  if (document.querySelector('#carousel')) {
    const carousel = new Carousel('#carousel');
  }
});
```

### Display loading indicator during transitions

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('animation:out:start', () => {
  document.querySelector('#loader').hidden = false;
});
swup.hooks.on('animation:in:end', () => {
  document.querySelector('#loader').hidden = true;
});
```

## Set all hook handlers at once

When creating a swup instance, you can register all your hook handlers at once by passing a keyed
object into the instance options.

```javascript
const swup = new Swup({
  hooks: {
    'visit:start': () => console.log('starting visit'),
    'page:load': () => console.log('loaded page'),
    'visit:end': () => console.log('finished visit')
  }
})
```

Hook handler options like `once` or `before` can be set by appending them to the hook name,
separated by a dot: `content:replace.before`, `fetch:error.once`, etc.

```javascript
const swup = new Swup({
  hooks: {
    'visit:start.once': () => console.log('triggers once'),
    'content:replace.before': () => console.log('triggers before hook')
  }
})
```

## DOM events

All hooks are also triggered on the `document` with a `swup:` prefix. They receive the hook name
and the visit object inside the detail key of the event.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('swup:page:view', ({ detail: { visit } }) => {
  console.log('Going to', visit.to.url);
});
```
