# Visit

The visit object contains information about the current page visit: the current and new
URL, the element and event that triggered the visit, as well as details about whether this visit
should be animated and which containers should be replaced.

Manipulate the visit object to control how swup will transition to the new page.

## Accessing the visit object

The visit object is available in all hook handlers.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('page:view', (visit) => {
  console.log('New page: ', visit.to.url);
});
```

## Shape of the visit object

This is an example visit object for a navigation from `/home` to `/about#anchor`.

```javascript
{
  id: 1042739, /* A unique ID to identify this visit */
  from: {
    url: '/home',
    hash: ''
  },
  to: {
    url: '/about',
    hash: '#anchor',
    html: undefined, /* The HTML string of /about, when it's loaded */,
    document: undefined /* The parsed document of /about, when it's loaded */,
  },
  containers: [
    '#swup'
  ],
  animation: {
    animate: true,
    name: 'fade'
  },
  trigger: {
    el: /* <a> element */,
    event: /* MouseEvent */
  },
  cache: {
    read: true,
    write: true
  },
  history: {
    action: 'push',
    popstate: false,
    direction: undefined
  },
  scroll: {
    reset: true,
    target: '#anchor'
  },
  meta: {}
}
```

## Use cases

What can we do by manipulating the visit object? A few examples are listed below.

Note that the most convenient place to hook into is on `visit:start` â€” all the information about the
current visit is already there, but no requests or animations have started yet.

### Disable animations

The new page will load instantaneously without animations.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', (visit) => {
  visit.animation.animate = false;
});
```

### Custom animation

Set a custom `.to-{name}` class on the html element to allow targeting via CSS.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', (visit) => {
  visit.animation.name = 'slide';
});
```

### Disable scroll reset

The current scroll position will be kept after the new page was loaded.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', (visit) => {
  visit.scroll.reset = false;
});
```

### Dynamic containers

Change which [content containers](/options/#containers) will be replaced on the current visit.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', (visit) => {
  visit.containers = ['#sidebar'];
});
```

### Access trigger element

Inspect the DOM element that triggered the current visit. Most probably a link element or undefined
if triggered via the API.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', (visit) => {
  console.log('Clicked link', visit.trigger.el); // HTMLAnchorElement
});
```

### Access trigger event

Inspect the DOM event that triggered the current visit. Most probably a click event or undefined
if triggered via the API.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', (visit) => {
  console.log('Click event', visit.trigger.event); // MouseEvent
});
```

### Identify history visits

Check if the current visit was triggered by the back/forward button of the browser. The
`popstate` key is a boolean indicating a history visit. The `direction` key holds information
about the direction of travel: `forwards`, `backwards`, or `undefined`.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', (visit) => {
  if (visit.history.popstate) {
    console.log('History visit', visit.history.direction);
  }
});
```

### Replace history entry

Tell swup to replace the current history entry, instead of creating a new one.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', (visit) => {
  visit.history.action = 'replace';
});
```

### Disable cache

Control whether swup will check for existing pages in the cache or save the newly loaded page
to the cache. Overwrites the behavior set in the [cache option](/options/#cache).

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', (visit) => {
  visit.cache.read = false;
});
```

### Do something with the incoming document

As soon as the next page is loaded, you can access the `document` of that page and do something with
it. For example, you could make sure the `lang` attribute is updated on your `<html>` element:

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('content:replace', (visit) => {
  const lang = visit.to.document?.documentElement.getAttribute('lang');
  if (lang) document.documentElement.setAttribute('lang', lang);
});
```

### Pass along custom metadata

Each visit has an empty `meta` object you can use to store arbitrary data with that visit. The data
will now be available in every hook handler along the way.

```javascript
swup.hooks.on('visit:start', (visit) => {
  visit.meta.lorem = 'ipsum';
});

swup.hooks.on('page:view', (visit) => {
  console.log(visit.meta.lorem); // 'ipsum'
});
```

When initiating a visit from the navigation API, you can pass in a custom metadata object as well:

```javascript
swup.navigate(url, { meta: { lorem: 'ipsum' } })
```
